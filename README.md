# How to commit
If you create a new file, you have to add it to the version control: `git add path/to/new/file.txt`

When you have done modification somewhere, you can commit locally with: `git commit -m "A description of my changes" -a` 

When you're ok with your modification, and you want to upload all online: `git push`

If you want to delete all your changes, and return back at the previous commit status: `git checkout`

If you encounter any merge problems, check the internet for the solution.

If you know how to work with branches, it could be better.

**BEFORE EVERY MODIFICATION** always do `git pull`, to get the latest version of all.

# How to execute services locally
(of course, you need to install docker)

`docker-compose up` on the root directory et woilÃ . Every time you save your code, everything reloads automatically

to run only some services: `docker-compose up service_name_1 service_name_2`. You can find service_names in docker-compose.yml.


## rebuild
`docker-compose build --no-cache service_name`


## multiple machine deploy 
> this part is useless now

init swarm: `sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(hostname -i)`
(optional) to add nodes follow the isstructions produced by the previous command.
something like `docker swarm join --token a_token 1.1.1.1:2377`
